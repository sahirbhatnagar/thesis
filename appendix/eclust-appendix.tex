\section{Description of Topological Overlap Matrix} \label{ap:tomdefinition}

Starting with a similarity measure $s_{ij}=|cor(i,j)|$ between node $i$ and node $j$, one could apply a hard threshold to determine if this pair is considered connected or not resulting in an un-weighted network (a matrix of 0's and 1's). Instead, Zhang and Horvath~\citep{zhang2005general} propose a soft thresholding framework that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair using a power adjacency function $a_{ij} = |s_{ij}|^{\beta}$. The parameter $\beta$ determines the sensitivity and specificity of the pairwise connection strengths e.g. a larger $\beta$ will result in fewer connected nodes which can reduce noise in the network but can also eliminate signal if too large. A measure of similarity is then derived using the symmetric and non-negative topological overlap matrix~\citep{ravasz2002hierarchical} (TOM) $\Omega = [\omega_{ij}]$:
\begin{equation}
\omega_{ij} = \frac{l_{ij} + a_{ij}}{min\left\lbrace k_i, k_j \right\rbrace + 1-a_{ij} }  \label{eq:TOM}
\end{equation}
where $l_{ij} = \sum_u a_{iu}a_{uj}$, $k_i = \sum_u a_{iu}$ is the node connectivity, and the index $u$ runs across all nodes of the network. Basically, $\omega_{ij}$ is a measure of similarity in terms of the commonality of the nodes they connect to. If $i$ and $j$ are unconnected and do not share any neighbors then $\omega_{ij}=0$. An $\omega_{ij}=1$ means that $i$ and $j$ are connected, and the neighbors of the node with fewer connections are also neighbors of the other node.

We fit the model to each of the 10 CV folds resulting in 10 sets of selected predictors. We then calculate the Jaccard Index between all $\binom{10}{2}$ possible combinations of these sets and take the average. This process is repeated for each of the 200 simulation runs. Vertical panels represent varying correlation between active clusters. Horizontal panels represent different signal-to-noise ratios.}

Dendrograms are from hierarchical clustering (average linkage) of one minus the correlation matrix for a, b, and d and the euclidean distance for c. The \textit{module} annotation represents the true cluster membership for each predictor, and the \textit{active} annotation represents the truly associated predictors with the response.}
